The SetAddress function will find an existing appropriate address range or create a new one when needed. The SetOrg call can set the current address without computing address ranges, which is useful to set the section before it is actually receiving any code.
	 	The Section class DO NOT store any content, it stores addressing areas to group them under a name.
