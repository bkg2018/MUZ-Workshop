#  MUZ C++ Assembler

MUZ is a C++ code base to implement an Assembler with a virtual computer and debugger.

Currently it's work-in-progress. It's a set of C++ source files which can be built a static library or put in another project.

Config.h must be customized for the CPU and computer to build. If MUZ is used as a library, the application must include the same Config.h that was used to generate the library.

Affiliated projects are in the Platform directory.
