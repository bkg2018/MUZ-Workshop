# MUZ-Workshop

***NOTICE: this is preliminary work ***

MUZ is a Z-80 development C++ 11 code base aimed at all OS-es, inspired by the [Small Computer Monitor Workshop from Steven Cousins](https://smallcomputercentral.wordpress.com/projects/small-computer-workshop/).

It's a *standard-as-can-be* C++ library featuring an internal C++ **Z-80 assembler** and a **computer model**, integrating the [YAZE Z-80 emulator](http://www.mathematik.uni-ulm.de/users/ag/yaze-ag) as the **virtual CPU**.

With MUZ, you can define IO ports and what they do, assign them to a virtual computer, set memory modules at the addresses of your choice, load hex files into them, run the program, or simply assemble source files right into memory.

MUZ has been designed to emulate the RC2014 backplane Pro with Z-80 CPU, Clock, Pageable ROM, 64KB RAM and SIO/2 Serial modules.

MUZ Assembler is designed to be compatible with Small Computer Workshop outputs, and can compile the SC Monitor sources with no modification.

The project also features a MacOS workshop, which uses the C++ MUZ library into a multi editor / debugguer / assembler development system which tries to bring to the Mac the same services as Steve Cousins SCWorkshop on Windows.

Main directories:

* `MUZ` : This is the main directory for the C++ code base and associated files
  * `Documentation` : holds various documents in Markdown for other formats, this is currently only work docs and should not be considered as strict specifications
  * `MUZ` : main C++ source directory
      * ` MUZ-Assembler` : source files related to the `Assembler` class
      * `MUZ-Common` : source files common to all parts of MUZ
      * `MUZ-Computer`: source files related to the computer model classes (memory modules, port modules, computer, cpu ...)
      * `Tests` : source files for testing programs, tghey all feature a main which must be linked to MUZ
  * `TestSources` : assembler source files for tests
  * `YAZE`: YAZE emulator integration and source files
      
* `Platform` : Main directory for OS specific files
      * `MacOS` : directory for MacOS specific files
        * `MUZ-Workshop` : project directory for the MacOS workshop application 
        * `MUZ-WorkshopTests`: directory for the MUZ-Workshop unit tests
        * `MUZ-Workshop.xcodeproj` : XCode 10 project file for the Workshop application 

There is no makefile or other OS development system project yet, you need XCode 10 to build the MUZ-Workshop project as of now. Apart from the MacOS UI and Objective-C Bridging specifics, anything in the `MUZ` root directory tries to stay standard C++ 11 which should be compilable on a lot of systems - as opposed to what's in `Platform` directory.
